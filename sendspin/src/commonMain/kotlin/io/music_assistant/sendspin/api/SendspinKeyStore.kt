 * Byte-blob persistence for the Sendspin identity and trust state.

 * The app provides the implementation over its own settings storage. The
 * identity secrets deliberately share storage with the MA auth token: a
 * separate hardened vault would protect the least valuable secrets in the app
 * while adding platform-keystore failure modes.
 *
 * Reads of missing or undecodable data return null and never throw: storage
 * loss must lead to clean identity regeneration, not a crash.
