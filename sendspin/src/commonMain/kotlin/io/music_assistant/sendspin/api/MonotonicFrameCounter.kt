/**
 * Extends a device frame counter that wraps at 32 bits into a monotonic count,
 * for [SinkHandle.position]. Feed every raw reading through [extend]; call
 * [reset] whenever the device counter restarts (flush, rebuild). Not thread-safe:
 * one owner, the sink's audio-thread caller.
 *
 * Each reading is placed in the wrap epoch nearest to the highest position seen
 * so far, and an older reading (a small rewind, or a lagging second source)
 * never moves that anchor. This assumes the counter is read far more often
 * than once per half range (about 12 hours at 48 kHz).
