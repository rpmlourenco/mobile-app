/**
 * Pins down which server flags hide a player and which only put it to sleep.
 *
 * The server keeps a player it can no longer reach in the registry: it flips `available`
 * to false and sends a player update, then re-registers the player when the device comes
 * back. Deleting such a player makes a speaker vanish from the app while it is in stand-by
 * (issue #944), so only `enabled` / `hidden` / `hide_in_ui` may hide one. Everything else
 * folds into [io.music_assistant.client.data.model.client.Player.isPoweredOff], which
 * renders the player asleep and offers the power button.
