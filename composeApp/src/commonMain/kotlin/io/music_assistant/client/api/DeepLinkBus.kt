 * ([io.music_assistant.client.ui.compose.home.MainNavigationRoot]) can be
 * composed, torn down, and re-composed during the cold-launch auth churn
 * (Main → Settings → Main as `sessionState` resolves). A one-shot channel gets
 * drained by the first, doomed instance and the rebuilt instance sees nothing.
 * A retained value survives that churn: the consumer applies it only once it is
 * authenticated and then calls [consume] to clear it, so it is honored exactly
 * once by the instance that actually stays on screen.
